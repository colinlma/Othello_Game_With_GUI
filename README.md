#README

This was done a year ago for an assignment in the advanced Python course at UCI.
I wrote and designed all of the code myself though it does require the tkinter library
for the GUI. This isn't meant for others to necessarily use and is instead intended to be viewed.

However, the project will work with just the python 3.3+ standard library.

Run game_board.py and provide input based on the instructions. From there, you can play the game
with a friend.

I soon plan on improving this by adding an AI which I hope to load as a web app. This will happen
soon after I take my AI course.
